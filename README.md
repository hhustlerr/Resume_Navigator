A smart, automated system that extracts key information from your resume, compares it with job descriptions using NLP techniques, and helps identify the best-fit roles â€” all while dynamically generating a polished LaTeX-based resume.

Problem Statement: Many job seekers struggle to identify roles that match their skills and experience. Recruiters often receive resumes that are poorly tailored to their job descriptions (JDs). This project solves that problem by:
Parsing resumes to extract relevant information and skills.
Parsing JDs to extract job requirements.
Matching the resume with multiple JDs using similarity scoring.
Generating a structured and professional resume in LaTeX format.
